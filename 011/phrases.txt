A bad workman blames his tools
A bad excuse is better than none
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A lie has no legs
All roads lead to Rome
Better late than never
Forbidden fruit is sweetest
Nothing venture, nothing gain
Rome was not built in a day.
Where there is a will there is a way
